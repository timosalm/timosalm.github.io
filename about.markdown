About
I'm a Principal Solutions Engineer with over a decade of experience in customer-facing roles, modern applications, DevSecOps, and AI.

At VMware Tanzu, I ensure that our most strategic customers in the EMEA region achieve their goals with our developer platform, data, AI, and commercial Spring products.
Additionally, I'm also enabling the broader field via, for example, trainings and supporting them in deep-dive sessions, PoCs, and executive meetings.

Another essential part of my role is continuously learning through experimenting hands-on with innovations and sharing the outcomes with my colleagues, the customers, and the community via, for example, conferences.

Iâ€™m honored to have been recognized as a Microsoft MVP in the Developer Technologies category for Java. An award that reflects my ongoing contributions to the developer community and passion for the Java ecosystem.

Before I joined Pivotal - a company focused on products and enablement for best practice software development that was acquired by VMware, and recently Broadcom - I worked for more than seven years for consulting firms in the automotive industry as a software architect and full-stack developer on projects for customer-facing products.

With extensive experience in software architecture and development, DevSecOps, and modern infrastructure such as Kubernetes and Serverless, I bring a strong background in building and modernizing applications. 

My specialization in artificial intelligence began during my computer science diploma and has since evolved into a focus on Generative AI. To deepen this expertise, I completed two Udacity nanodegrees in AI and Generative AI and, for the second year now, have been delivering conference talks on the subject, sharing insights from my ongoing work in the field.
