Timo Salm is the first Solution Engineer for Developer Experience at Tanzu by Broadcom in EMEA, focusing on internal developer platforms and commercial Spring products. In this role, he's responsible for educating customers on the value of these products and ensuring that they succeed by working closely on different levels of abstractions of modern applications and modern infrastructure.
An essential part of his role is also continuously learning through experimenting hands-on with new tools and sharing the outcomes with his colleagues, the customers, and the community, and evangelizing to communities via e.g. social media, articles, and conferences.

Before Timo joined Pivotal, which VMware and now Broadcom acquired, he worked for consulting firms in the automotive industry as a software architect and full-stack developer on projects for customer-facing products.
He has extensive experience in software architectures and development using e.g. Spring, Angular, and Swift(iOS), but also with modern infrastructure.
