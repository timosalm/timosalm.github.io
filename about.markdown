I'm a Principal Solutions Engineer with over a decade of experience in customer-facing roles, modern applications, DevSecOps, and AI.

At VMware Tanzu, I ensure that our most strategic customers in the EMEA region achieve their goals with our developer platform, data, AI, and commercial Spring products.
Additionally, I'm also enabling the broader field via, for example, trainings and supporting them in deep-dive sessions, PoCs, and executive meetings.

Another essential part of my role is continuously learning through experimenting hands-on with innovations and sharing the outcomes with my colleagues, the customers, and the community via, for example, conferences.

Before I joined Pivotal - a company focused on products and enablement for best practice software development that was acquired by VMware, and recently Broadcom - I worked for more than seven years for consulting firms in the automotive industry as a software architect and full-stack developer on projects for customer-facing products.

I've extensive experience in software architectures and development, DevSecOps, and modern infrastructure like Kubernetes and Serverless.

Currently, I am deepening my expertise in artificial intelligence, having completed two Udacity nanodegrees in AI and Generative AI. I also recently delivered my first conference talks on AI.
